      <h5><strong>1. Age restriction</strong></h5>
      <p>
        Our website and services are directed to people from the ages of 18 and
        above. We do not knowingly engage in people younger than the age of 18.
      </p>
      <h5><strong>2. The payment services we provide you</strong></h5>
      <p>
        We enable you to make or receive immediate or future payments to or from
        other people (a payment transaction). In order to enable you to make a
        payment transaction, we will set up and maintain a payment account for
        you (we will call this 'your account'). Once we have set up your
        account, you may ask us to make a payment transaction to another person
        (a payment recipient) by paying the requisite amount to a payment
        recipient into your payment account and providing us with an instruction
        on when; or, upon satisfaction of what conditions, you wish us to
        release funds to that payment recipient.
      </p>
      <h5><strong>3. Using your account</strong></h5>
      <p>
        Your account is for your personal use only, unless we have set you up as
        a Business customer. You may use it solely for the purpose of making
        payment transactions to payment recipients.Your account cannot be used
        in any way to store funds that do not relate to a specific payment
        transactions you have asked us to make. As all funds that are in your
        account relate to pending payment transactions, your account is not
        accessible to you and you cannot ask us to deal with the funds other
        than by amending or cancelling your payment order for that payment
        transaction. Your login details enable you to place payment orders (as
        set out below) with us and see a record of your payment orders and
        payment transaction, as well as see the status of those orders and
        transactions. It does not give you access to your account or enable you
        to control funds within your account. Your account cannot, therefore, be
        accessed or operated by a third party.You must not use your account for
        any illegal purpose. This means that you cannot use our services or your
        account for anything that might violate any laws or regulations. Where
        you do so we may then decline, cancel or revoke any or all transactions
        progressing and report such information we hold to law enforcement
        agencies as detailed in our privacy notice. For information on
        activities or transactions that are considered for illegal purpose, you
        may make a direct request from us at www.vesicash.com/contactFunds in
        your account will be held in accordance with the Escrow section of these
        Vesicash Payment Services Terms. Interest is not paid on funds paid into
        your account.
      </p>
      <h5><strong>4. Setting up a payment transaction</strong></h5>
      <p>
        Payment transactions you may make are split into two separate elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is a payment that you will normally arrange with your bank or
          credit card provider to pay us the amount of the funds you want to pay
          to a payment recipient in respect of the payment transaction, which
          will be held by us in your account;
        </li>
        <li>
          There is an instruction you give to us for us to make a payment
          transaction to a payment recipient. This is the payment order.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The payment order is submitted to us by logging on to the Vesicash
        platform and creating, authorising and authenticating an instruction
        form using our online platform or mobile application.
      </p>
      <p>In order for us there to be a valid payment order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You must provide us with details of the payment recipient comprising
          their full name, email address and/or mobile phone number as a minimum
          (it has to be sufficient information to enable us to match their
          details with the relevant Vesicash user or provide the details we need
          to contact the person you wish to pay);
        </li>
        <li>
          Service Level Agreements on the Vesicash includes but not limited to
          the following
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
            You will specify the amount of the payment transaction to be made to
            the payment recipient;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
            You will provide a brief description of the nature and reference for
            the payment transaction;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
            You will specify the inspection period for the transaction;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px">
            You will specify either that you want payment to be made:
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-left: 60px">
            Immediately upon funds clearing into your account
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-left: 60px">On a specific future date; or</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-left: 60px">
            When certain specified conditions have been satisfied (e.g. that you
            have notified us via the Platform that a contract has been
            completed, goods have been received or the payment recipient has
            notified us that the goods have been dispatched).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you submit a transaction we will validate the details and, if the
        payment recipient is not a Vesicash user, we will take steps to on-board
        them to the Vesicash platform. Once those steps are complete, we will
        confirm that you should fund your account for an amount equal to the
        amount of the proposed payment transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        To transfer funds to your account, you should use one of the accepted
        funding mechanisms specified including: direct bank transfer, USSD,
        credit or debit card payment, the Pay-By-Bank-App and/or such other
        funding mechanisms we may make available. It is important that you
        provide funds exactly equal to the proposed payment transaction
        (including escrow service charges) – no more, no less. You will not have
        completed a valid payment order until we have credited the funds
        corresponding to that payment transaction to your account. Funds
        received by us after 6pm (Nigerian Time) will be credited to your
        account the following day.
      </p>
      <p>
        A payment transaction must be paid to your Vesicash account in a single
        payment to a payment recipient and we will not accept any funding for a
        payment transaction split into staged or part funding i.e for a split or
        milestone transaction, you are expected to make the full payment for the
        transaction and not pay into Vesicash installmentally. If we receive
        funds less or more than the amount of the intended payment transaction
        to the other Vesicash user then we will not make any part or
        over-payment and will return the entire funded amount to you as soon as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the payment recipient is not registered with Vesicash and you have
        funded your account in respect of the payment transaction and the
        payment recipient does not register with us within seven business days
        from our request to register, we will cancel the payment order and
        return the amount you have funded to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a specific date for the payment transaction is not specified and the
        payment transaction is conditional, you will also specify a long-stop
        date not exceeding three calendar months by which the payment
        transaction will be made.<br /><br />&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2><strong>How are transactions completed?</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Once we have received a valid payment order, we will hold the funds
        relating to that payment order in your account until the time you have
        asked us to complete the payment transaction, which might be on the date
        the specific conditions that you have specified are satisfied, on a
        specified future date, or immediately that you have funded your account
        (funds release time). At the funds release time, we will complete the
        payment transaction by making a payment to the nominated account of the
        payment recipient. We make the payment by the faster payments service or
        other method elected by are you. Please allow for a minimum of 24 hours
        from when the transaction was funded, before funds are released to the
        Seller or Service Provider.<br /><br />&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2><strong>How are disputes resolved?</strong></h2>
      <p>
        When initiating a transaction on the Vesicash platform, users are asked
        to determine the procedure by which they will resolve any dispute or
        misunderstanding that may arise during the course of the transaction.
        This procedure comes into effect once a dispute is initiated during a
        transaction and the transaction funds will remain in the escrow account
        until the dispute is mutually resolved between the transacting parties.
        Dispute resolution procedure available to users of the Vesicash platform
        are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Mutual resolution</strong>:&nbsp;If this option is selected by
          the user when initiating a transaction, should the event of a dispute
          arise, the transaction will be in a state of “In Dispute” until both
          parties have come to an agreement over the resolution, and have marked
          the transaction as completed or have mutually agreed to cancel the
          transaction in which case the funds are returned to the Paying Party.
          While the transaction is in this state, the transaction funds will
          remain securely held in the transactional escrow account.<br /><br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-party Resolution</strong>:&nbsp;Third party alternative
          dispute resolution procedures may be required for certain
          transactions. However, this option may be made available (at the
          discretion of Vesicash) only for transactions above a stated value
          threshold. If users agree to this option when initiating a
          transaction, should the event of a dispute arise, if the transaction
          is in the “In Dispute” state, the details of the transaction will be
          forwarded to a neutral third party recommended or selected by
          Vesicash. Such neutral third parties include alternate dispute
          resolution officials, licensed by a professional body in Nigeria such
          as LCA and the Institute of Chartered Mediators. The fees payable to
          mediators would depend on several factors, including the complexity
          and technicality of the dispute, the time involved in settling the
          dispute as well as the number of mediators with the level of
          experience to handle the dispute in relation to that subject matter
          within the relevant jurisdiction. Mediator’s fees will be borne by the
          transacting parties and are negotiated between the parties and
          mediator at their discretion. Once an agreement has been reached by
          the parties, the Terms of Settlement are reduced into writing and this
          constitutes a binding and enforceable contract. Once this is achieved,
          the transaction funds are released according to this decision, after
          which the transaction is closed. While the transaction is in the “In
          Dispute” state, the transaction funds will remain securely held in the
          transactional escrow account.<br /><br />&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>Payment Refunds</strong></h2>
      <p>
        In the event of a cancelled transaction or a partial refund to the
        Paying Party, the Paying Party’s funds will be refunded back to the
        source of the payment method used to fund the transaction. The
        transaction fee is non-refundable.<br /><br />&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2><strong>Safeguarding your funds</strong></h2>
      <p>
        As a registered business, we are required to hold funds that you pay to
        your account separate from our own so that the funds are protected. We
        hold the funds in what is known as a 'transactional account', which is a
        separate bank account which is held with a commercial bank and which
        holds these funds completely separate from ours.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Funds in the safe transactional account are Vesicash users' funds and
          do not include any of our funds;
        </li>
        <li>
          The funds in your account belong to you until a payment transaction is
          completed in accordance with a payment transaction you have submitted;
        </li>
        <li>
          We have to comply with strict regulatory obligations in relation to
          the transactional account which are to protect you;
        </li>
        <li>
          The funds in the transactional account are protected and your
          interests regarding the funds are protected should an event occur,
          leading to us being unable to carry out our services as expected.<br /><br />&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>Liability Limitations</strong></h2>
      <p>
        If anything goes wrong in a payment that we are involved in, but this is
        due to abnormal or unforeseeable events outside of our control, which
        would have been unavoidable even if we had taken all steps to prevent
        them, we will not be responsible to you for any losses and costs caused.
        Also, if we are unable to meet our obligations to you or perform our
        services due to legal or regulatory obligations or changes that apply to
        us, we will not be responsible to you for any losses or costs incurred.
